<i>This tab needs to be rewritten properly</i><br>
The terminal screen is where students actually log in or out ...
<ul>
<li>include screen shot</li>
<li>Students log in by entering their computer login id, eg. smitjohn123.
The student id number can also be used. This would be for scanning in student cards</li>
<li>The next time that the student enters their login id they are logged out.</li>
<li>If the user (teacher) clicks on the Beal Logo, a prompt pops up for the teacher to enter 
the bypass password. After this is done, the teacher can then log a student in/out by typing his/her name.
</li>
</ul>
