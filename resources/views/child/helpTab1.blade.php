<h5><b><u>Kiosk:</u></b> the team, club, group, department, ... that is tracking attendance.
Because this is program flexible enough to encompass all of these different
groups/teams/classes/categories, "kiosk" is being used as the general term for them all.

<h5>This program is designed to enable a variety of groups such as classes, teams, clubs, departments,
	to track students' attendance/location.</h5> 
	<div class="alert alert-info col-md-6">
	<h5><i class="icon fa fa-info"></i> There are three possible modes</h5>
	</div>

<div class="callout callout-info">
<h5 class="text-dark">1. <u>Sign-in and sign-out</u></h5>
<p>This tracks the time that the student signs in and also requires him/her to sign-out.</p>
<p>Possible uses would be departments such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the library
<li>student success
<li>detention room
<li> etc.
</ul>

<p> This could be used for
<ol type="i">
<li> allowing teachers to see when a student actually arrives and leaves the library / Resource /
Student Success / Guidance
<li> verifying that the student has a spare when they check into the library without a slip.
<li> tracking usage for urban-funding grants
</ol>
<p>These kiosks would normally be set to <b>public</b> so that all teachers can see who is there,
when they arrived, when they left,
and can search for a particular student.</p>
<p>If a student forgets to signout, there is an autosignout option that will sign the student out
at the specified time (e.g. end of period)
</p>
</div><!-- end callout -->

<div class="callout callout-success">
<h5 class="text-dark">2. <u>Present Only</u></h5>
<p> This is used when you just need a record of who (students only) was present at a meeting and
signing out doesn't make sense.<br>
Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Gamer's club (or any club) : used for applying to Student Council for funding, listing students who can get Letters.
<li>Raider Robotics : taking attendance at the beginning of each general meeting takes an inordinate amount
of time. This would speed it up significantly.
<li>BILP : recording attendance in the morning (and at lunch?), formatted in a way such that entry
to Web Attendance is simple.
<li>Indoor sports teams : attendance for each practice. <br>
<i>This probably won't work for outdoor teams since this program is only available via the inhouse
school network. Wifi wouldn't reach to the field.</i></li>
</ul>

These kiosks would normally be set to <b>private</b> so that only the teachers running the club/team
can see the participants and attendance.
</div><!-- end callout -->
<div class="callout callout-success">

<h5 class="text-dark">3. <u>Event based for classes</u></h5>
<p> This mode allows you to specify a class list of students and also an event with a check in time. 
It shows which students are present/late/absent.<br>
This was created especially for the Dance Programme, where they have rehearsals and shows and need to track which of the 130 students are missing before the show starts. (Teachers also wanted to know who was late, to deduct marks from those students as well.) </p>
<p>Details</p>

These kiosks should be set to <b>private</b> so that only the teachers running the event can see who was absent/late.
